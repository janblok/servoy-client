/**
 * Types that implement this interface do send some useful contents in template JSON (either through {@link NGConversions.IFormElementToTemplateJSON},
 * or just the design value is useful large json) but at runtime - when the application/record/... becomes available the want to update that value without
 * sending it again completely.<br/><br/>
 *
 * For example a "component" (child component) type sends in the template any child component properties that want to be in template, and at runtime (when initial
 * data is requested) they should only send initial runtime property changes, not the whole bunch of child component properties that were aready sent/cached through
 * the template. The same thing that a form currently does.
